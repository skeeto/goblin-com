├────────────────────── Gk{How to Play} ───────────────────────┤

  Ck{Goblin-COM} is  influenced heavily  by X-COM:  UFO Defense,
but rather than being set on  Earth in the distant future of
1999,  it's set  in  a Tolkienesque  fantasy  world at  some
undetermined date.

├─────────────────────── Gk{Your Role} ────────────────────────┤

  You  control  a number  of  Yk{heroes}  grouped together  into
Yk{squads}.  As goblins  arrive, these  squads are  sent out  to
intercept  the invaders  on the  geoscape screen.  Once your
squad catches up with the  goblins, you'll be dropped into a
battlescape to deal with them in turn-based combat.

  On the geoscape screen you'll  also be able to construct a
number of  different Yk{buildings}  to grow your  economic base.
Buildings  must  always  be constructed  adjacent  to  other
buildings. You  start with just  a single Yk{castle}  (Yk{C}), which
provides  you a  base set  of Yk{resource}  income. You  must be
careful  to  defend  your   buildings,  because  the  goblin
invaders will destroy them!

  The game ends when either your entire people are wiped out
due  to your  castle being  heavily assaulted,  or when  you
figure out how to resolve the story. Mk{Good luck!}

├───────────────────── Gk{User Interface} ─────────────────────┤

  Anything  marked with  Rk{red}  indicates a  key binding.  For
example, you  should have pressed  Rk{p} to access  this window,
and  the red  arrows  on  the right  margin  of this  window
indicate scrolling.

  In the  main geoscape view,  the Rk{<}  and Rk{>} keys  adjust the
speed.  Different submenus  are accessed  by pressing  their
displayed red key binding. Use Rk{q}  to save and quit, and Rk{Q} to
quit without saving. Any menu can be exited using the Rk{escape}
key or Rk{q}.

  On the  heroes window use  the arrow  keys to move  up and
down through  your available heroes.  Use < and >  to switch
pages.  Use Rk{+}  and  Rk{-} to  adjust to  which  squad this  hero
belongs.

  On the squads window press  the squad's letter to select a
new  target for  that squad.  Invaders will  be marked  with
unique letters from which you can pick.
